# Transformer-based-Any-step-Dynamics-Model-for-MBRL
This project introduces TADM (Transformer-based Any-step Dynamics Model), which combines the flexible long-range prediction of Any-step Dynamics Models with the power of Transformers. By using an anchor state and a sequence of actions, TADM avoids error buildup from step-by-step prediction and removes the need for recurrent networks.
